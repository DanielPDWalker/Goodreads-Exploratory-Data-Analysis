# GoodReadsBooks-DataAnalysis
  
This notebook is a look into the GoodReadsBook data set from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks), downloaded on the 16/09/19 at 13:23 gmt.  
  
The idea for the project itself was more a learning exercise, with two main aims; firstly finding out what interesting things I could from the data, and secondly just doing a lot more with seaborn and associated libraries.  

A lot of my work was learnt through another notebook on the Kaggle website, also based on this dataset. [Link here.](https://www.kaggle.com/hoshi7/goodreads-analysis-and-recommending-books)
